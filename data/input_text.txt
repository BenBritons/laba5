A mathematical function is a rule that gives value of a dependent variable that corresponds to specified values of one or more independent variables. A function can be represented in several ways, such as by a table, a formula, or a graph. Except for isolated points, the mathematical functions found in physical chemistry are single-valued. Except for isolated points, the mathematical functions that occur in physical chemistry are continuous. Thermodynamic theory and quantum mechanical theory specify the number of independent variables for the functions in that occur in these disciplines.
